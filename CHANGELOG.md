# CHANGELOG

The change log for the Rust [socketcan](https://crates.io/crates/socketcan) library.


## [Version 3.1.0](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/compare/v3.0.0..v3.1.0)  (2023-10-12)

- Added a number of netlink commands to modify the CAN interface parameters. including: setting the bitrate and (for FD) setting the data bitrate, setting control modes, manually restarting the interface, and setting the automatic restart delay time.
    - [PR #50](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/50) Add set_bitrate method
- [PR #45](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/45) Dump handles extended IDs
- [PR #44](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/44) Fix clippy warnings
- [PR #43](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/43) Implement AsPtr for CanAnyFrame


## [Version 3.0.0](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/compare/v2.0.0..v3.0.0)  (2023-09-19)

- Support for Rust async/await
    - All of [tokio-socketcan](https://github.com/oefd/tokio-socketcan) has been merged into this crate and will be available with an `async-tokio` build feature.
    - [#41](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/41) Added initial support for `async-io` for use with `async-std` and `smol`
    - Split `SocketOptions` trait out of `Socket` trait for use with async (breaking)
    - Added cargo build features for `tokio` or `async-io`.
    - Also created specific build features for `async-std` and `smol` which just bring in the `async-io` module and alias the module name to `async-std` or `smol`, respectively, and build examples for each.


## [Version 2.1.0](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/compare/v2.0.0..v2.1.0)  (2023-09-19)

- Made `CanAddr` pulic and added functions to help interact with low-level sockaddr types. Sockets can now be opened with an address.
- Can create an `Error` directly from a `CanErrorFrame` or `std::io::ErrorKind`.
- [#46](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/issues/46)  Applications can create error frames:
    - `CanErrorFrame::new()` now works.
    - `CanErrorFrame::new_error()` is similar but more intuitive using a raw ID word.
    - `From<CanError> for CanErrorFrame` to create an error frame from a `CanError`.
- Added `Frame::from_raw_id()` and `Frame::remote_from_raw_id()`
- Bumped MSRV to 1.65.0


## Version 2.0.0  (2023-04-06)

Extensive rework of the crate to cleanup, refactor, and modernize the library and add some new features like CAN FD support.

- Moved to Rust Edition 2021 w/ MSRV 1.64
- Refactored frames into differnt types: Data, Remote, Error (and now FD), that can be managed through enumeraed wraper types `CanFrame` and/or `CanFdFrame`
- Pushed some implementation upsream to the _libc_ and _nix_ crates, and/or adapted upstream types.
     - CAN 2.0 frames based on `libc::can_frame`
     - CAN FD frames based on `libc::canfd_frame`
- [#33](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/33) Netlink extensions
    - Creating and deleting interfaces
    - Setting MTU (to/from FD)
- [#21](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/21) New CI using GitHub Actions
- [#20](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/20) Composite PR with some modernization
    - Pulls in [#13](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/13), and updates to the latest `neli` v0.6
    - Updates `nix` dependency to latest v0.23
    - Moves to Rust 2018 w/ MSRV 1.54
    - Errors conform to std::error::Error
- [#16](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/16) Add CAN FD support
- [#24](https://github.com/socketcan-rs/socketcan-rs/pull/24) Embedded HAL Traits
    - Plus some source refactoring into more coherent modules
